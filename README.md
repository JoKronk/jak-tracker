- Tracker UI Customization!
  - **Icon layout** is defined in `layout.yaml`
  - **Colors/sizing/etc** are defined in `prefs.yaml`
  - **Custom icons** can be used - just replace the corresponding PNG file(s) in the `icons` subfolder
  - *Both of the above YAML files and the entire `icons` subfolder should live in the same folder as `JakTracker.exe`*
